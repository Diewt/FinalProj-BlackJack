# FinalProj-BlackJack


This python project utilizes Github actions to automate testing the moment a push is made to the respository. If the testing fails and email will be sent notifying me of a failed test. If push gets past the test phase, github action will then release the program on github, which I assumed is a type of deployment as it becomes a single packaged file availabe for people to download.
