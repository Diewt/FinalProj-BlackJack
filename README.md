# FinalProj-BlackJack


This python project utilizes Github actions to automate testing the moment a push is made to the respository. If the testing fails and email will be sent notifying me of a failed test. If push gets past the test phase, the program will be built and deployed on heroku. However since the program is a console application, heroku is not able to properly display the deployed program even if it builds and deploys successfully on the Heroku console.
